# Write a Python Program to Find the Sum of Natural Numbers.

'''
    Natural numbers are a set of positive integers that are used to count and order objects.
    They are the numbers that typically start from 1 and continue indefinitely, including all the
    whole numbers greater than 0. In mathematical notation, the set of natural numbers is often
    denoted as "N" and can be expressed as:
 '''

limit = int(input("Enter the limit: "))

#   Initrialize the sum
sum = 0 
#   Use a for loop to calculate the sum of natural numbers 
for i in range(1, limit + 1):
    sum += i

#   Print the sum
print("The sum of natural numbers up to ", limit, "is:", sum)
